# REAPER COLOR THEMES

i am mainly trying to develop a light and a dark theme
that go together with the reaper-keys project.

i am trying to learn how to develop themes and it is a lot 
of fun. My goal is to try to make a theme with as few images
and fluff as possible. I only want to make it as clean and
cool as possible. with good high contrast borders so that 
you can see stuff super easilly.
